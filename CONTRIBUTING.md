# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## What to Contribute

**Issues:** Report bugs or request features using [GitHub issues][issues].

**Documentation:** You can send documentation changes via pull requests.

**Bug fixes:** You can send bug fixes via pull requests.

**Tests:** gg aims to be a stable part of a developer workflow, so it's vitally
important that it is robust to a wide variety of failures.  Even if nothing is
broken, adding new tests is always welcome.

**Features:** If you want to add a feature, please discuss it in on the issue
tracker first. Also, take a look at [DESIGN.md][], which outlines the scope of
features and the ideas behind the project.
