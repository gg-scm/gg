# gg

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/zombiezen/gg/badge.svg?branch=master)][coveralls]

gg is a wrapper around [Git][] that behaves like [Mercurial][]. It works well enough for
my everyday use. It can be thought of as an alternate [porcelain][] for Git.

## Getting Started

Download the latest [release][releases] from GitHub.  Binaries are available for
Linux and macOS.

To use the version at `HEAD`, run `go get zombiezen.com/go/gg/cmd/gg`.

You must have a moderately recent copy of Git in your `PATH` to run gg. gg is
tested against Git 2.7.4 and newer. Older versions may work, but are not
supported.

Once you have gg installed in your `PATH`, the [Working Locally][] guide will
show you how to use the basic commands. The [main site][] also includes workflow
guides and reference documentation.
