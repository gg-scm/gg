This is a collection of guides that show how to use gg's commands in practice.
**If you are new to version control, start with [Working Locally][]**. The other
guides show how to share your work with others; the one you need depends on how
the project you are contributing to accepts changes.

Note: gg is a command-line program, so these guides assume you know how to use
the command line for your platform.
